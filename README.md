cassandra-d
===========

D language cassandra client (currently binary api v1)

Currently this driver can be used to create / insert / update / delete data in a cassandra datastore.

There are currently no helpers, you can only execute CQL inputting or retrieving data.

#### Works:
- Queries
- Prepared Statements

### Todo:
- UUID stuff
- Provide helper functions/templates
- Clean up code
- Lots!
